The code you provided has a small but critical error.

**The Error:**

In the line `return total / len`, `len` is a built-in function in Python, not the length of your `numbers` list. When
you try to divide `total` by the `len` function object itself, you'll get a `TypeError` because you can't perform
arithmetic operations with a function object.

**Corrected Code:**

To fix this, you need to call the `len` function with your `numbers` list as an argument: `len(numbers)`.

```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
total = 0
for i in range(len(numbers)):
total += numbers[i]
return total / len(numbers) # Corrected line: len(numbers) instead of len

print(calculate_average([1, 2, 3, 4]))
```

**Output of the corrected code:**

```
2.5
```

**Explanation of the fix:**

* `len(numbers)`: This correctly evaluates to the number of elements in the `numbers` list (which is `4` in your
example).
* `total / len(numbers)`: This then performs the division of the sum (`10`) by the count of elements (`4`), resulting in
`2.5`.

**Pythonic Improvement (Optional but Recommended):**

While your loop for summing is perfectly functional, Python offers more concise ways to achieve the same:

```python
def calculate_average_pythonic(numbers):
if not numbers: # Handle empty list to avoid ZeroDivisionError
return 0.0
return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

print(calculate_average_pythonic([1, 2, 3, 4]))
print(calculate_average_pythonic([])) # Example for empty list
```
